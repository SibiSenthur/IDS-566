      "because he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep \n",
      "with his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what \n",

      "soon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said\n",
      "that we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have\n",
      "fractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the\n",
      "first floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around\n",
      "eleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I \n",
      "saw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies\n",
      ". . . everything just like a war.\n",
      "\n",
      "They carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical\n",
      "people from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older \n",
      "Armenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud \n",
      "she would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle \n",
      "Arkady, I think, because someone said \"Arkady, get an injection ready,\" he \n",
      "started to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But \n",
      "when he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his \n",
      "sixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and \n",
      "started to cry: \"What have they done to you?!\" He was speaking Armenian. \"What\n",
      "have they done to you?!\" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and \n",
      "she started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \"I'll give you a shot.\" \n",
      "Mamma tells him, \"I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what \n",
      "are they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people,\n",
      "and you're just sitting here!\" Some teacups were standing on the table in \n",
      "there. \"You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my \n",
      "daughters! Look what they've turned them into!\" They gave her something to \n",
      "drink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the\n",
      "doctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa \n",
      "and Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina \n",
      "out. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I \n",
      "don't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: \"What's \n",
      "the matter with you?\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter\n",
      "in the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's.\n",
      "I said, \"I'm fine.\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told \n",
      "the doctor, \"You leave, let a woman examine her.\" A woman came, an \n",
      "Azerbaijani, I believe, and said, \"What's wrong with you?\" I was wearing my \n",
      "sister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When \n",
      "she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would \n",
      "be easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed\n",
      "her. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge \n",
      "wound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said \n",
      "something to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be \n",
      "dressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "They put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. \n",
      "I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't \n",
      "know if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \"Lie still, you mustn't move.\" When\n",
      "I was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed \n",
      "very familiar to me. I shouted, \"Stop!\" One of the policemen turned and says, \n",
      "\"What do you want?\" I say, \"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\" They \n",
      "brought him over and I said, \"That person was just in our apartment and he \n",
      "just raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\" They said, \n",
      "\"Fine,\" but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were \n",
      "taking him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were \n",
      "sitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car \n",
      "up closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \"Sister . . . \" I don't \n",
      "remember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they\n",
      "did to us. I asked him, \"Where are you from?\" He said that he was from Ufa. \n",
      "Apparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I \n",
      "learned that they suffered most of all. He says, \"OK, you're Armenians, they \n",
      "didn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian,\" he says, \"what are they trying \n",
      "to kill me for?\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the \n",
      "balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw \n",
      "two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed \n",
      "against the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him\n",
      "with his own club. The way he cried \"Mamma\" made my skin crawl. I don't know \n",
      "what they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before \n",
      "he attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the\n",
      "third or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was \n",
      "Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they\n",
      "were throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with \n",
      "someone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the \n",
      "yard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that\n",
      "I realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.\n",
      "\n",
      "They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too \n",
      "and said, \"I've been beaten too, help me.\" But they just ignored her. My \n",
      "father went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault \n",
      "that he'd been beaten, and says, \"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have \n",
      "probably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\" The doctor says, \"That's not my\n",
      "job.\" Urshan said, \"Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, \n",
      "I'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them \n",
      "to his apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the \n",
      "doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I \n",
      "wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very\n",
      "surprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the\n",
      "Hippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--\n",
      "coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,\n",
      "having examined Karina, said, \"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like \n",
      "they did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.\n",
      "\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she\n",
      "would certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same \n",
      "story. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no \n",
      "drugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon\n",
      "found out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And\n",
      "they started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at \n",
      "zoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from \n",
      "seeing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have \n",
      "any serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their \n",
      "place, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira \n",
      "her daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And\n",
      "Ira was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.\n",
      "When they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she \n",
      "involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again.\n",
      "Her daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful \n",
      "when I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \"Do what\n",
      "you want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\" Well, they did what they \n",
      "wanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I \n",
      "would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It \n",
      "was simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do \n",
      "every day: steal, kill, rape . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "Many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts \n",
      "explained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those \n",
      "children would be grown, and then, as they put it, \"we'll come take the \n",
      "pleasure out of their lives, those children.\" This was about the girls that\n",
      "would be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow \n",
      "because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just\n",
      "as there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be \n",
      "of some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the \n",
      "victims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that\n",
      "they would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they\n",
      "themselves said that.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many \n",
      "people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know \n",
      "why their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before, \n",
      "maybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and \n",
      "they weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at \n",
      "nothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with \n",
      "Marina: \"Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over \n",
      "there [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman \n",
      "shouldn't see such things.\" So they were really quite sober . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "So we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all \n",
      "happened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several \n",
      "hours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what\n",
      "happened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk-\n",
      "ing to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he\n",
      "thought no one is listening: \"Listen,\" he'll say, \"what could I do? What could\n",
      "I do alone, how could I protect them?\" I don't know where to find the words,\n",
      "it's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen. \n",
      "That's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of \n",
      "course he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail\n",
      "of what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke\n",
      "together in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never\n",
      "present at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And\n",
      "when the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.\n",
      "\n",
      "On February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.\n",
      "First they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, \n",
      "the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. \n",
      "There were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family \n",
      "there. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They \n",
      "were sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife \n",
      "and Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.\n",
      "There's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.\n",
      "They took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought\n",
      "that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become\n",
      "so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.\n",
      "The women were shouting. They explained to them: \"We want to hide you\n",
      "better because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We\n",
      "had children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to \n",
      "have their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. \n",
      "They kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you \n",
      "could see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the \n",
      "police precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is \n",
      "surrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were \n",
      "standing on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought \n",
      "great psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't \n",
      "just walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48,\n",
      "or those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost \n",
      "family members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened \n",
      "when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single\n",
      "person, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must\n",
      "have already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret \n",
      "room down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at\n",
      "one another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those \n",
      "people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that\n",
      "the end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the \n",
      "hospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my \n",
      "parents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should \n",
      "attack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an \n",
      "Armenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and \n",
      "she wouldn't be able to take it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people \n",
      "climbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.\n",
      "They all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We \n",
      "calmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some \n",
      "little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children\n",
      "to the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never \n",
      "have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people \n",
      "do eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They \n",
      "were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from \n",
      "the courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a \n",
      "different woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, \n",
      "and calling out: \"Oh, Rafik!,\" but when she heard about this such a rage came \n",
      "over her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her \n",
      "sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were \n",
      "soldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were\n",
      "standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up\n",
      "to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash \n",
      "him! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not \n",
      "one of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from \n",
      "doing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, \n",
      "muttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile\n",
      "appeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round\n",
      "was over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing \n",
      "terribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the \n",
      "creeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did \n",
      "this the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She \n",
      "went five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, \n",
      "\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they \n",
      "raped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though \n",
      "nothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?\" She appealed to everyone, but no \n",
      "one got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I \n",
      "could barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so \n",
      "many hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already\n",
      "after ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the \n",
      "elderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. \n",
      "There was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. \n",
      "The situation was deplorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "At eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, \n",
      "Azerbaijanis. They said, \"Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up\n",
      "and put the children to bed.\" Now the women didn't want to leave this place, \n",
      "either. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with \n",
      "dogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \"Oh, it's our little \n",
      "family,\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for \n",
      "the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone\n",
      "spoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded\n",
      "machine guns in their hands, said, \"Grandmother, you mustn't approach me,\n",
      "I'm on guard.\" Our people would say, \"Oh, that's all right.\" They hugged\n",
      "them, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly\n",
      "moving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "They took us up to the second floor and said, \"You can undress and sleep in \n",
      "here. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city.\"\n",
      "This was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other\n",
      "places. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the\n",
      "SK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I \n",
      "asked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.\n",
      "I didn't know what was happening there. They told me, \"Don't worry, the\n",
      "Maternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest\n",
      "assured. I say, \"Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in\n",
      "there is capable of anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had\n",
      "already been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-\n",
      "tal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once\n",
      "we were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met \n",
      "acquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who \n",
      "hadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with \n",
      "them, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had \n",
      "come their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like \n",
      "they had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, \n",
      "hungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of \n",
      "course the stories and the talk were flying: \"Oh, I heard that they killed \n",
      "him!\" \"What do you mean they killed him!\" \"He stayed at work!\" \"Do you know \n",
      "what's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very \n",
      "well and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small \n",
      "room, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night \n",
      "talking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary \n",
      "of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see \n",
      "Bagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed \n",
      "from outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask \n",
      "him things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by \n",
      "soldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with \n",
      "the people. Apparently he had more important things to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \"Lyudochka, find another \n",
      "two or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, \n",
      "lists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people \n",
      "who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\" I \n",
      "had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \"Lyuda, your \n",
      "Mamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are \n",
      "alive and well and that you're here.\" I gave the lists to someone and asked \n",
      "them to continue what I was doing and went off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's\n",
      "father, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels\n",
      "Grigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the \n",
      "name of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said \n",
      "that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front\n",
      "of the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later \n",
      "it turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had\n",
      "somehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for \n",
      "Krasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that \n",
      "in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored \n",
      "missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3\n",
      "\n",
      "All the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were \n",
      "contained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple \n",
      "of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \"What's \n",
      "going on?\" He said, \"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels\n",
      "they are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev\n",
      "[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party\n",
      "of the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to\n",
      "him, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it\n",
      "was one or fifty.\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they\n",
      "should ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over\n",
      "again. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26\n",
      "was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because\n",
      "that's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 \n",
      "people on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only \n",
      "a half of those that were on the first list. He said, \"Lyuda, please, try to\n",
      "remember at least one more.\" But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there\n",
      "were more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy\n",
      "don't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people \n",
      "whose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of\n",
      "the Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many \n",
      "people left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns\n",
      "in Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the \n",
      "Krasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that \n",
      "there are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical \n",
      "Krestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk \n",
      "cows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went \n",
      "to help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering\n",
      "the city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the \n",
      "Azerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's\n",
      "more. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list \n",
      "drawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course\n",
      "don't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to \n",
      "publicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court, \n",
      "they simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them\n",
      "is the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. \n",
      "8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know \n",
      "her name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in \n",
      "Microdistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the \n",
      "same landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding \n",
      "the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and \n",
      "when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her \n",
      "braid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because \n",
      "they didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one \n",
      ". . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "They transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for\n",
      "days in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there \n",
      "and I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina; \n",
      "it was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could \n",
      "already walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the \n",
      "social work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, \n",
      "\"If it weren't for the work I would go insane.\" He and I put ourselves in gear\n",
      "and took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers \n",
      "and free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, \n",
      "although we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been \n",
      "dispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it \n",
      "was free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by\n",
      "to see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly\n",
      "visible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "On March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir\n",

      "\n",
      "Shirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I \n",

      "We didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the\n",
      "conditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor \n",
      "quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there \n",
      "weren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a \n",
      "curfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or \n",
      "video cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that \n",
      "we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially \n",
      "to draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw\n",
      "that the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to \n",
      "Sumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with \n",
      "Bibishev, I told him myself, \"Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two \n",

      "gave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to\n",
      "her, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-\n",
      "self. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-\n",
      "rays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat\n",
      "and drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we\n",
      "were in Baku already, the investigator told me, \"How long can you go on like \n",
      "this? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're\n",
      "not taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this\n",
      "investigation through. We need you.\" Then I started eating, because in fact I\n",
      "was exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-\n",

      "every prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of\n",

      "who went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the \n",

      "his first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his \n",
      "sisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that \n",

      "simply for keeping him out of Armenia,\" that is, to keep him from landing in\n",
      "a prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the\n",

      "\n",
      "The investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire\n",

      "that I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was \n",
      "in our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and \n",
      "all the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned \n",

      "from the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James \n",
      "Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were \n",

      "enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't\n",
      "even know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did \n",

      "slippers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. \n",
      "Basically, the group that went seeking \"revenge\"--let's use their word for \n",

      "asked me, \"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\" I told him, \"I'll tell you one more\n",
      "identifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The \n",
      "name Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\" He went rigid and became \n",
      "pale. They told him, \"Put your hands on the table.\" He put his hands on the\n",
      "table with the palms up. I said, \"Now turn your hands over,\" but he didn't \n",
      "turn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start\n",
      "acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they \n",
      "forced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.\n",
      "But he insolently stuck to his story, \"No, I did not do anything, it wasn't \n",
      "me.\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his\n",
      "hand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew\n",
      "into a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out \n",
      "of granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. \n",
      "Catching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked\n",
      "and the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and \n",
      "back. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how, \n",
      "but I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or \n",
      "strangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the \n",
      "microphone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his\n",
      "last name, and he says, \"Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . .\n",
      "\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. \n",
      "They took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, \n",
      "because we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \"You're \n",
      "some actress! What a performance!\" I said, \"Tolya, honestly . . . \" Beforehand\n",
      "they would always tell me, \"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if \n",
      "nothing had happened to you.\" I say, \"I don't have any more strength or \n",
      "emotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength \n",
      ". . . I don't have the strength to do anything.\" And he says, \"Lyuda, how were\n",
      "you able to do that?\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching\n",
      "the tape, I said, \"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped \n",
      "that high in gym class.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of \n",
      "the 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who \n",
      "beat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his \n",
      "guilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among\n",
      "them were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, \n",
      "\"Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three\n",
      "o'clock.\" He said, \"No, I'm not coming.\" They told him, \"If you don't come \n",
      "we'll kill you.\" He said, \"Alright, I'll come.\" And he went.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He\n",
      "had also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a \n",
      "motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him \n",
      "out of his apartment and told him the same thing: \"Tomorrow we're going to get\n",
      "the Armenians. Be there.\" He said, \"No.\" They pulled a knife on him. He said, \n",
      "\"I'm not going all the same.\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed \n",
      "him several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was\n",
      "in the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that \n",
      "we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he\n",
      "beat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he\n",
      "was very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for\n",
      "him, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning\n",
      "of Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our \n",
      "apartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our \n",
      "apartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I \n",
      "don't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked\n",
      "out very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina\n",
      "because he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the\n",
      "courtyard, he remained in the apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "At one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her\n",
      "I learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't \n",
      "have a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third\n",
      "and, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work\n",
      "with bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.\n",
      "\n",
      "The others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't\n",
      "call them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out\n",
      "someone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, \"I don't \n",
      "understand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\" But we know that\n",
      "they were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the\n",
      "name of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--\n",
      "that's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do.\n",
      "Because I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their\n",
      "level of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they\n",
      "work, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they \n",
      "crowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were \n",
      "promised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.\n",
      "So off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \"they \n",
      "promised us apartments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Among them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the\n",
      "heart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a \n",
      "children's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at \n",
      "the children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they \n",
      "have they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or \n",
      "grandparents. And he said, \"I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how\n",
      "I ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my \n",
      "own, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\" And the whole time I\n",
      "kept repeating, \"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife \n",
      "right before your own eyes.\" He sat there and just wailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a \n",
      "marvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just \n",
      "have to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his\n",
      "grandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how \n",
      "to cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he \n",
      "knew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed \n",
      "himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.\n",
      "\n",
      "That one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr \n",
      "Gambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \"Let's go, enough, you've spilled\n",
      "enough blood here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was \n",
      "that they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya\n",
      "and her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They \n",
      "liked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When \n",
      "Karina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors \n",
      "old me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to \n",
      "the entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were \n",
      "already at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back\n",
      "and started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have \n",
      "sustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older \n",
      "woman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of \n",
      "Karina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.\n",
      "The woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands \n",
      "and led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, \n",
      "he sees everything, and He won't forgive this.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first \n",
      "floor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a\n",
      "custom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.\n",
      "But they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is \n",
      "tantamount to trampling a woman's honor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we \n",
      "have gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these \n",
      "events that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come \n",
      "about? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that \n",
      "without a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not \n",
      "have happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,\n",
      "let other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their \n",
      "nations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are \n",
      "a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for\n",
      "what they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like\n",
      "unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they \n",
      "threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,\n",
      "to snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on\n",
      "February 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone \n",
      "who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left\n",
      "for their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got\n",
      "as far away as their legs would carry them.\n",
      "\n",
      "February 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came \n",
      "into my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had \n",
      "been a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for \n",
      "a meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few \n",
      "teachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or \n",
      "seven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there \n",
      "were a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the \n",
      "evening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and \n",
      "the crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the \n",
      "microphone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the \n",
      "driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani\n",
      "child off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had\n",
      "seen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \"Death to the Armenians! They must\n",
      "be killed!\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because \n",
      "people were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The \n",
      "woman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians \n",
      "cut her daughters' breasts off, and called, \"Sons, avenge my daughters!\" That \n",
      "was enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the \n",
      "direction of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "We stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a \n",
      "very nationalist speech. He said, \"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\" This \n",
      "he repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him \n",
      "stormily, whistling and shouting \"Karabagh!\" He said, \"Karabagh has been our \n",
      "territory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my \n",
      "heart?\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \"It's our \n",
      "territory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. \n",
      "From time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from\n",
      "time immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years \n",
      "the Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\" By filth he meant \n",
      "Armenians.\n",
      "\n",
      "I heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely.\n",
      "Many people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with \n",
      "the other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate,\n",
      "that in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our\n",
      "teachers said, \"Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's \n",
      "spouting,\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we \n",
      "listened to the woman's speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the \n",
      "subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of\n",
      "studies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I\n",
      "had considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to \n",
      "obtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,\n",
      "\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If \n",
      "they find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I \n",
      "tell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?\" When he \n",
      "said it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a \n",
      "second time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already\n",
      "after eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, \n",
      "\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until \n",
      "twelve. Stay here.\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in \n",
      "kindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \"I left my \n",
      "children at the kindergarten.\" The director excused her. When she let her go I\n",
      "turned around, said, \"Good-bye,\" and left with the young teacher, the \n",
      "Azerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran\n",
      "nearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too \n",
      "much for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed \n",
      "off. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher \n",
      "wouldn't say that I was an Armenian.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at \n",
      "the movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and\n",
      "again my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched \n",
      "television as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last \n",
      "day. That's how it all was.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,\n",
      "Zhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store \n",
      "on Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she \n",
      "doesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father \n",
      "held the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the \n",
      "ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went \n",
      "out on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the \n",
      "entryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders \n",
      "there. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the \n",
      "moment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been \n",
      "injured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, \n",
      "and their children: any way they could. \n",
      "\n",
      "Where it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin, \n",
      "Armen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims \n",
      "what was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one \n",
      "another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even \n",
      "with muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and \n",
      "their old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got \n",
      "them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked \n",
      "electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then \n",
      "they took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an \n",
      "Azerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director\n",
      "and told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to \n",
      "escape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of \n",
      "course, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only\n",
      "thing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The \n",
      "Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored \n",
      "personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and\n",
      "led everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored \n",
      "personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that \n",
      "very moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "I heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big, \n",
      "strong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a \n",
      "strong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking \n",
      "for the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, \n",
      "people hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps \n",
      "dead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went \n",
      "with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found \n",
      "Azerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and \n",
      "put down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or \n",
      "infection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the \n",
      "neighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject \n",
      "came up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the \n",
      "basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor\n",
      "carried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing \n",
      "as one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor \n",
      "took his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything \n",
      "seemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing \n",
      "of ours he had managed to \"save.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Raya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended \n",
      "themselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were\n",
      "Azerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some \n",
      "reason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just \n",
      "victims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. \n",
      "In the TV show \"Pozitsiya\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that \n",
      "the Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not \n",
      "important, the truth will come out regardless.\n",
      "\n",
      "So that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our \n",
      "bravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the \n",
      "years and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've \n",
      "become, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.\n",
      "\n",
      "On that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said\n",
      "that it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments\n",
      "received by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans \n",
      "will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the \n",
      "Procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-\n",
      "tion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on \n",
      "the street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear\n",
      "speaking our native tongue.\n",

      "was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \"Ka-ra-bagh,\" they're not going \n",
      "to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's\n",

      "Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and \n",
      "no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that \n",

      "home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda \n",
      "Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did\n",
      "our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something\n",
      "awful was happening in town. I asked, \"Don't they want Armenians? Well what \n",
      "are they after, if they're already in that state?\" She says, no, nothing like \n",
      "that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels\n",
      "like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The \n",
      "cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy \n",

      "on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\" Papa didn't know what she\n",
      "was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home \n",
      "and told Mamma. Mamma said, \"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means\n",
      "that something is really going on.\" But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian,\n",
      "she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I \n",

      "you out.\" Mamma says, \"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can \n",
      "see what the situation in town is.\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was \n",
      "ready. Mamma says, \"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\" We sat down at the \n",
      "table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything \n",
      "out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating.\n",
      "We turned on the television, and the show \"In Fairy-Tale Land\" was coming on. \n",
      "We cleared the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't \n",
      "see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus\n",
      "station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people \n",
      ". . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking\n",
      "somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's \n",
      "an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down\n",
      "to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story \n",
      "buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 \n",
      "people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see \n",
      "several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide\n",
      "that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not \n",
      "killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of \n",
      "the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their \n",
      "feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in \n",
      "general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak\n",
      ". . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .\n",
      "If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him\n",
      "and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he\n",
      "got up and left or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "I become terrified and go home and say, \"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our\n",
      "place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \" Then the crowd \n",
      "runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and \n",
      "starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors \n",
      "are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is \n",
      "shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it \n",
      "turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and \n",
      "kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop \n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,\n",
      "afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the \n",
      "windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, \n",
      "and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't \n",
      "crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge\n",
      "cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey \n",
      "Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear \n",
      "tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous \n",
      "din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were \n",
      "shouting Father's name, \"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\" or\n",
      "something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma \n",
      "says, \"Into the bedroom, quickly!\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part \n",
      "of our dowry; Mamma says, \"Hide there, they probably won't come in there, \n",
      "they'll ask something, say something, and leave.\" She says, \"We'll tell them \n",
      "that we live alone here.\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in \n",
      "the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say \n",
      "that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I \n",
      "can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak \n",
      "Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and\n",
      "Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told \n",
      "her anything or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell\n",
      "right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,\n",
      "leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I\n",
      "tell them, \"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what\n",
      "has happened.\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \"Get out of the apartment, leave.\" I \n",
      "say, \"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the \n",
      "apartment.\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with\n",
      "them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the\n",
      "doorway, the young guys, say, \"There are old people and one girl with them.\n",
      "Too bad!\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have\n",
      "pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, \n",
      "commanding them: \"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one\n",
      "room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start \n",
      "undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, \n",
      "in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how \n",
      "much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,\n",
      "and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The \n",
      "atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among \n",
      "themselves who would go first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes\n",
      "in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. \n",
      "He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It \n",
      "seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything\n",
      "depends on him. He looks and says, \"Well, we're done here.\" They are beating\n",
      "Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs \n",
      ". . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was\n",
      "out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the \n",
      "window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the \n",
      "windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking \n",
      "about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong \n",
      "person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that\n",
      "I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, \n",
      "which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they \n",
      "don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I \n",
      "humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my\n",
      "tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing \n",
      ". . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't \n",
      "know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by \n",
      "my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, \n",
      "something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone\n",
      "else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death \n",
      "come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near\n",
      "the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What \n",
      "happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.\n",
      " \n",
      "I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me \n",
      "clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember \n",
      "that I said the same words over and over again: \"Mamma, what happened, Mamma, \n",
      "what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\" I can't make \n",
      "sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he\n",
      "served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all \n",
      "went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his \n",
      "courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though \n",
      "he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he \n",
      "served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served\n",
      "there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor \n",
      "brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \n",
      "\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\" How do I know who's who \n",
      "and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then\n",
      "Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when \n",
      "they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda \n",
      "said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the\n",
      "Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going \n",
      "to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's \n",
      "hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our \n",
      "sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding \n",
      "on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in \n",

      "\n",
      "My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.\n",
      "While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back \n",

      "there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put \n",

      "one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and \n",
      "knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \"I'm not going to let you \n",

      "simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed\n",
      "between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.\n",

      "of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary \n",
      "passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right \n",
      "after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a \n",
      "great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and\n",
      "what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not \n",
      "only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, \n",
      "without stopping. After us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from\n",
      "Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died\n",
      "from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young \n",

      "Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives\n",
      "to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in \n",
      "Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \"Run\n",
      "quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay\n",
      "alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away.\" At that moment \n",
      "three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such\n",
      "awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, \n",
      "there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything \n",
      "out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face\n",
      "was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my\n",
      "normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to \n",
      "scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you \n",
      "here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of \n",
      "the soldiers said, \"Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the \n",

      "\n",
      "When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,\n",
      "there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know,\n",
      "maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously \n",
      "injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they \n",
      "were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda \n",
      "and me and said, \"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't \n",
      "know what to do with the rest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My \n",
      "boss said, \"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter\n",
      "what happens.\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department\n",
      "head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She \n",
      "examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait \n",
      "ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People \n",
      "called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something\n",
      "very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, \n",
      "\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\" She looks me over and \n",
      "says, \"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been\n",
      "doing, your people did even worse things.\" And I think, great, I have to deal \n",
      "with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to\n",
      "have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this \n",
      "condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't \n",
      "have the energy to say, \"How could our people possibly be smart enough to \n",
      "think of something that yours haven't already done?\" I stayed there. Then they\n",
      "brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her \n",
      "own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next \n",
      "morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This\n",
      "was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything \n",
      "more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer, \n",
      "nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at \n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-\n",
      "pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That\n",
      "same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face\n",
      "was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \"Better to ask \n",
      "your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can \n",
      "better explain what happened.\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw \n",
      "themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my\n",
      "ward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me \n",
      "clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, \n",
      "but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up \n",
      "above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \"I can't believe you put on such a\n",
      "short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\" I went back to my \n",
      "ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and \n",
      "brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I \n",
      "couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said\n",
      "that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one \n",
      "had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . \n",
      "Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should \n",
      "be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an \n",
      "Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must \n",
      "have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something \n",
      "else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on\n",
      "the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, \n",
      "and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to\n",
      "the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.\n",
      "I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many \n",
      "troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw \n",
      "a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought \n",
      "that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait \n",
      "after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't \n",
      "come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. \n",
      "I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm \n",
      "me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw \n",
      "a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each \n",
      "other and asking, \"What happened, what went on?\" Two days later they came to \n",
      "see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed \n",
      "interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they \n",
      "could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues \n",
      "who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions, \n",
      "neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what \n",
      "happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart \n",
      ". . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, \n",
      "not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part \n",
      "of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements\n",
      "with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by\n",
      "myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my\n",
      "lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I \n",
      "lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be \n",
      "from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular.\n",
      "When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of \n",
      "insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. \n",
      "There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took \n",
      "me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were \n",
      "emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's \n",
      "friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic. \n",
      "They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I\n",
      "needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty\n",
      "breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.\n",
      "They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some\n",
      "people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all\n",
      "bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I\n",
      "wasn't cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon \n",
      "appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not \n",
      "talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \"We \n",
      "demand that Seidov come!\" The response was, \"It's Seidov who sent us.\" Seidov \n",
      "is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, \n",
      "\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same \n",
      "things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you \n",
      "agitators.\" And so on. More of them said, \"Have Seidov himself come.\" This \n",
      "went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us \n",
      "out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because \n",
      "they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The \n",
      "smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who \n",
      "had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a \n",
      "club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay \n",
      "to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day \n",
      "someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.\n",
      "Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie \n",
      "theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it \n",
      "was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants \n",
      "took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in \n",
      "Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to \n",
      "mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting \n",
      "right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only \n",
      "the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women \n",
      "were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come \n",
      "any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered \n",
      "together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie \n",
      "theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to \n",
      "the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and \n",
      "couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently \n",
      "they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the\n",
      "theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my \n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \"Aren't you an \n",
      "Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\" They\n",
      "led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their\n",
      "passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did\n",
      "not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in \n",
      "nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like\n",
      "they should have, with their IDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On\n",
      "Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't \n",
      "spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,\n",
      "they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered \n",
      "the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-\n",
      "in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only \n",
      "the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, \n",
      "she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the \n",
      "building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. \n",
      "This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were \n",
      "already in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire \n",
      "families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians\n",
      "or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't \n",
      "see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult \n",
      "now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify \n",
      "the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in\n",
      "gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard \n",

      "had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were \n",
      "going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply \n",
      "savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did \n",
      "what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that \n",
      "hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians\n",
      "out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they\n",
      "put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from \n",
      "the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the \n",

      "in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were \n",
      "standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the \n",

      "And he became furious. The woman tells him, \"She came to . . . \" She didn't\n",
      "know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would\n",
      "comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \"She\n",
      "came to and went to the basement.\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the \n",
      "whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took \n",
      "flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been \n",
      "standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there \n",
      "to get me. Then one of them said, \"There's so much water down there, she \n",
      "probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in \n",
      "the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\" I didn't know that, and \n",
      "when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't \n",
      "just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really \n",
      "didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and \n",
      "started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. \n",
      "Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people \n",
      "who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think \n",
      "that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but \n",
      "they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole \n",
      "brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been\n",
      "enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\" That's \n",
      "all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not \n",
      "one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were \n",
      "standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are\n",
      "you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women \n",
      "that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a\n",
      "bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for \n",
      "one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, \n",
      "an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: \n",
      "if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed \n",
      "to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they\n",
      "stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \"If\n",
      "you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\" So she left.\n",
      "That trick didn't work on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget \n",
      "that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it\n",
      "had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them, \n",
      "then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. \n",
      "And no one did anything. Anything.\n",
